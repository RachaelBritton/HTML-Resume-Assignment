  <h1>How to Draw a Human Face</h1>
</header>

<p> Hi there! In this tutorial I will show you how I go about drawing a human face. In this tutorial we will be drawing the
   face from the front. I will be drawing a female face which usually has more rounded edges and fuller shapes. If you want to watch a full video of my drawing process you can go to the bottom of the page
   where I have inserted a time-lapse recording of my process. </p>

<body>
  <main>
    <div id="Step1">
    <h2>Step 1: Face Shape</h2>
    <p> The first thing to do is draw a circle and a line a few centimeters under the circle. This line will be the chin. Depending on how you want the face to look the chin line can be closer or farther away from the center circle.
      (Males usually have longer jaws so in this example I would keep the chin close to the center circle.)
      Once you have drawn the chin line, connect the circle to the jaw line so that the head has a slight upside-down teardrop shape. We want to be careful about our angles here. Sharp lines and angles are unnatural, but if you want a more stylized approach go for it.
  Lastly we are going to add a vertical line that splits the face in half.</p></div>

    <div id="Step2">
    <h2>Step 2: Planning the facial features</h2>
    <p> In this next step we are going to draw a horizontal line at the center of the face. Now the face should have roughly four equal parts.
      Draw another horizontal line above your horizontal center line, (this line should be roughly 1/3 of the way up to the top of the head). This is where the top of the eyebrows will be.
      Draw another horizontal line below the horizontal center line, (this line should be about 2/3 of the way down the face and will be the upper lip.)</p></div>

    <div id="Step3">
    <h2>Step 3: Adding the Eyes</h2>
    <p>The visible part of the eyes generally form an almond shape. We will draw these two "almonds" right at the horizontal center line of our face.
      The eyes should be positioned halfway between the vertical center line and the edge of the left/right side of the face.
      Once the general shapes of the eyes are placed, add the irises and a curved line above the eye shape to indicate the eyelids.
     Be careful not to put the eyes too close together or far apart!</p></div>

    <div id="Step4">
    <h2>Step 4: Adding the Nose</h2>
    <p> As guidelines for the nose, draw two parallel lines coming down from each inner corner of the eyes.
      The two lines should not touch the lower horizontal line indicating the upper lip.
      Once you have your lines drawn, drawn an oval connecting the two. Then, draw two smaller circles overlapping the sides of the oval.
      These will be our nostrils.</p></div>

    <div id="Step5">
    <h2>Step 5: Adding the Eyebrows</h2>
    <p> Drawing the eyebrows is one of the most important parts for me because the eyebrows are key to expression in the human face.
      If you are trying to draw a neutral face or an expressive one I would recommend looking up pictures as reference.

      Anyways, to start off drawing the eyebrows we are going to draw two rectangles on the upper horizontal line of the face. This is the body of the brow.
      Then we will draw a small triangle at the end of each eyebrow (the end closest to the edge of the face) as these will help us draw the arch of the brow.</p></div>

    <div id="Step6">
    <h2>Step 6: Adding the Lips</h2>
    <p> Now we will focus on the bottom portion of the face. Since I am drawing a female I am going to make her lips more plump and rounded.
      We will begin by drawing the upper lip at the lower horizontal line. I usually draw them as a rounded letter m. Then we will add a line below the m which will be the parting line between the upper
      and lower lips. To indicate the lower lip we will use an arch. The end of each lip should be in line with the iris of the eye. </p></div>

    <div id="Step7">
    <h2>Step 7: Adding the Ears</h2>
    <p> On each side of the face we are now going to add the ears. The top of the ear should be slightly below the eyelid, and the bottom should be slightly below the nostrils.
      The shape of the ear is mainly a series of three connected arches.
      Starting with the top of the ear we will draw a small arch going away from the face. Then we will make a separate arch connecting with the first angling back down, closer to the face.
      The last arch will connect to the second arch and represent the earlobe as it curves back in farther and connects with the face.</p></div>

    <div id="Step8">
    <h2>Step 8: Hair</h2>
    <p> The hairstyle is completely up to you. To show volume and depth, I would make sure that there is plenty of space between the face and the hair.
      The hair should not be too close to the eyebrow, as we want to make sure that the forehead is large enough. However since female usually have narrower and shorter foreheads than males we will bring the hairline a bit closer to the eyebrows. </p></div>
